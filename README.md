# Neural Network From Scartch 

This project is an assignment from the course "Deep Learning" at BGU.
The main purpose of this assignment is to implement a Neural Network from scratch, without any libraries 
like Tensorflow or PyTorch. 

## The Goal Of This Project
The goal of this project is to gain an idea of how deep learning frameworks work behind the
scenes.
stuff like backward-propagation, optimization, influence of hyper parameters and more.

## Details About The Project
The first part was to implement standard neural network, the 
should make a classification on three different data-sets.

The second part was to do the same, but with Residual NN instead of 
standard neural network.

The project was written in Python language. the loops in Python
are not efficient in terms of run-time, so i tried to avoid the usage of the
loops and do a lot of stuff with a matrix notations
